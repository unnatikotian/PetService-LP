              <p>

                A black Labrador, Bruno was beaten to death by two juveniles and a youth Monday at the Adimalathura
                beach in Thiruvananthapuram. The matter came to light after the dog’s owner posted a video of the brutal
                assault, which went viral on social media.

                “Our sole endeavor will be to alert the State Executive to the circumstances in which, and the extent to
                which, it will be required to act in discharge of its constitutional and statutory obligations,” said
                the court.

                It added: “We believe that a meaningful effectuation of rights can be achieved only when the different
                branches of Government work in concert, and it is this co-operation that we expect in the course of
                these proceedings.”
                When the court sought a feasible action plan from the state animal welfare board for an awareness
                campaign to sensitise the citizens about the rights of animals, it was told that the board is yet to be
                constituted.

                At this, the court directed the state advocate general to get information on the steps taken by the
                government to reconstitute and render it functional.

                The state was also told to explore the possibility of entrusting the district administrations with the
                power to enquire into complaints of infringement of animal rights, cruelty to animals and also instances
                where persons are prevented from keeping pets of their choice in their residential apartments. The bench
                will hear the matter again on 17 July.

                Labrador Worth Six Lakhs Found Dead; Ex-Owner Accused Of Murder

                A Labrador dog was found murdered brutally in the Karnal district of Haryana, and a case has been
                registered by his owner at the Karnal police station. According to the grieving owner, the previous
                owner of the lab (whom he had named Chhota Raja) was the one responsible for the murder of his dog, who
                was reportedly worth around six lakh rupees.

                The owner, named Sagar, today met the SP of Karnal, Gangaram Poonia and filed an FIR against the
                previous owner, who is absconding. He said that he had bought the dog from a dealer at Shergarh Khalsa
                in Karnal by paying three lakh rupees. According to him, he had taken care of Chhota Raja and made him
                into a strong and healthy dog. After he grew up, the old owner wanted to buy him back for six lakh
                rupees, but Sagar refused.

                The dog was kidnapped a few days ago. Sagar told the media that he suspects that the dog’s food was
                laced with drugs, as a result of which he lost consciousness, after which the kidnappers took him away.
                The dog’s body was found in a bad condition, leading the police to believe that he had been at the
                receiving end of a brutal thrashing by the people who killed him.


                Sagar and his friends have started a campaign to bring the matter to light and to punish the brutal
                killers of his beloved Chhota Raja. The police have registered a case against the culprits.
